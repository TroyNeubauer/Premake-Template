# Premake Template

This is the default template I use for new [premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) C++ projects. Feel free to download the zip and use it for your convenience. The premake5 executable for windows is included along with a semi-complete premake5.lua file. This project is also accompanied with scripts for generating project files on Windows and Linux.
